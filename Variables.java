    /*How to create the names of the variables:
    It may contain only letters, numbers and mentioned signs: $ or  _
    Name can not start from numbers
    It can not contain key words such as: class, int, public etc...
    Names should be written in accordance with convention of Camel Case such as: myNameOfVariable
    It's possible to use $ and _ but  it is customary not to do this in the names of variables
    Use names that best describe the meaning of the variable instead of "a", name it according to what it represents, such as "currentSpeed"
    It's good when names are short and reflect the meaning well, but don't be afraid of long names, if the situation requires it (meaning > length)*/
